San Francisco recommendations
=============================

Views
-----
* Grand View Park - kind of under the radar but one of my favorites. At the corner of 16th Ave & Moraga, and then keep going up the stairs until you reach the top of the hill.  You get a 360 panorama of the west side of the city.
* Twin Peaks - a lookout at the top of the highest peak in the city (you can drive to the top), great view if it's a pretty clear day, which is a big if.  If it's even a little cloudy at sea level it will be very foggy at the top of TP.
* Corona Heights Park - this is sort of like a Twin Peaks Junior, situated in front of Twin Peaks, a little lower, but unlike TP you can sometimes have it all to yourself.
* Treasure Island - only a few minutes from downtown by car, you cross the Bay Bridge halfway and get off, get a view of the skyline and the bay.
* Top of the Mark - the bar on the top floor of the Mark Hopkins hotel, you can get a great view of downtown and looking west over the rest of the city.
* Angel Island/Tiburon - You can take a ferry from downtown to Tiburon which is a nice little harbor town in the North Bay.  From there you can take another ferry to Angel Island in the middle of the bay and walk around.  Makes for a great day if the weather is nice, but with only a few days you may not want to burn a whole day on it.
* Indian Rock Park - You can take BART across the Bay to Berkeley and walk to Indian Rock Park, which is a nice view of the bay/SF looking west.  Probably only worth it if you end up going to the East Bay already.
* Tower at the DeYoung - not worth a special trip, but if you're at the DeYoung anyway, there's an observation tower you can go up and see a nice view.

Walks
-----
* Crissy Field: walk along the water and see about ten billion people playing with their dogs.  Views of the GG Bridge, Marin Headlands, etc.
* The Embarcadero: the waterfront promenade all the way from AT & T Park to Fisherman's Wharf.
* The Mission: always lots going on along Mission and Valencia.
* North Beach: one of the few places where I feel like old-school San Francisco is still hanging in there.  Old Italian restaurants, dive bars, Chinatown, all that good stuff.
* Ocean Beach: you can walk along a few miles of uninterrupted beach on the west side of the city.
* Land's End: a hike you can do from the northwest corner of the city towards Baker Beach, very nice and pretty short.  Starts near the Cliff House restaurant, which is a good spot for an expensive beer with an ocean view.

Museums
-------
I'm not much of a museum guy, but the California Academy of Sciences and SFMOMA (MOMA is closed at the moment, I think?) are my favorites. I'm not so hot on the DeYoung, but artsier people than I seem to like it.

Golden Gate Park
----------------
GGP is beautiful but also huge and mostly just open fields, there's not much of an epicenter.  There's the conservatory of flowers, the botanical gardens, Stowe Lake, and a few other things.  If you do go, focus on the east end of the park.  I wouldn't make it a top priority.

Day trips/drives
----------------
If you can get your hands on a car somehow, there are a few drives/excursions very close to the city that are really spectacular, two in particular:

1. The drive on Pacific Coast Highway (Route 1) from Pacifica to Half Moon Bay is gorgeous, takes about a half hour.  Dramatic cliffs and beaches, lots of nice stops on the way.  For bonus points you can stop at Sam's Chowder House in Half Moon Bay for food at the end and take in the view of the harbor.

2. Go north across the Golden Gate Bridge, take the first real exit (past the view point parking lot), and turn left to go under the freeway.  This puts you on Conzelman road, which winds through the Marin Headlands with views of the bridge, San Francisco, and the Marin hills.  It's maybe 15 minutes from the bridge to the end, where there's an old lighthouse (Point Bonita) you can reach by rickety wooden suspension bridge.  The whole drive is like a car commercial.

Miscellaneous
-------------
* The Ferry Building downtown has lots of good food and is a nice area to walk around.  If you're there on a Saturday the Farmer's Market will be bustling.
* Cable cars - can you believe that I've actually never been on one of these?  Seems impossible.  I have nothing to offer about them.
* If you want to get a taste of American baseball, AT & T Park is a great place to watch a game.  You can also walk around the back of the stadium and there's a little area near right field where you can go in and watch for free for a few innings from under the stands, at field level.  It's pretty neat if you're in the area and there's a game going on.
* When you look at a map, make sure you account for topography. Something that looks like an easy 2-mile walk could turn out to be a grueling vertical climb.
* For local flavor, Mission Dolores Park is always hopping on a weekend, equal parts hippie and yuppie.
* Some other photo opps: old industrial stuff around Mission Bay and the Dogpatch neighborhood; the Painted Ladies and old Victorians around Haight-Ashbury and the Western Addition.
* Fisherman's Wharf, Coit Tower, and the rest of the standard tourist canon is mostly pretty lame, I think, if you aren't traveling with kids.  The Golden Gate Bridge is really the one "classic" that lives up to the hype.
* BART is actually pretty convenient/fast, but it doesn't go that many places.  For going to the Mission or downtown or the East Bay, it's a good system.  You can also take it to/from SFO quite easily, it goes right up to the door of the international terminal.  You can take the N Judah line all the way out to Ocean Beach, it's on the slow side but reasonably convenient.

Food
----

There are so many restaurants in San Francisco you could go to a new one for every meal of every day and not keep up, so this list is very far from complete, but here are some of my favorites:

### Bakeries
* Tartine Bakery - If you are a "wait in a really long line for the bakery everyone loves" kind of person, this is the one.  Don't even try to go on a weekend.
* Arizmendi's - More low-key than Tartine, also good.
* Devil's Teeth Baking Company - out in the middle of nowhere near the beach, but one of my favorites.  Without a car you almost certainly won't go here.  Fantastic breakfast sandwiches, and every Sunday is Beignet Sunday.

### Brunch
* Pork Store Cafe
* Foreign Cinema
* Mission Beach Cafe
* Yank Sing (dim sum)

### Lunch/Dinner
*  Taqueria Cancun (Mexican) - You really can't go wrong if you're looking for Mexican food in The Mission.  This is my personal favorite.  El Farolito is probably the most popular local burrito place.  Papalote is very good but is a little less Mexican and more Californified.
* Bill's Place (burgers)
* B*Star Cafe (Burmese) - really good Burmese place in the Inner Richmond.  Not to be confused with Burma Superstar, their slightly more formal place down the street which is harder to get a table at.
* San Tung (Chinese)
* Thai Time (Thai)
* Sawaii Ramen (Ramen)
* Sushi Zone (Sushi) - only seats about 10 people at a time so you may have to wait
* Ike's Place - a famous sandwich spot, they make delicious abominations with all kinds of interesting fillings.
* Rosamunde's (sausages)
* M & L Market (an old neighborhood institution, pastrami/corned beef sandwiches)
* Gott's in the Ferry Building (American) - the food is good but the setting is even better if the sun's out
* Delfina Pizzeria (pizza)
* Suppenkuche (German)

### Beer
* Toronado on Haight Street used to be my local bar of choice, good beer selection.

### Dessert
* Humphrey Slocombe Ice Cream - My personal favorite of many good options.  Bi-Rite Creamery is also quite good.
* Smitten Ice Cream - A unique experience, flash-frozen liquid nitrogen ice cream served out of a shipping container in Hayes Valley.
* Mission Pie
* Anthony's Cookies
