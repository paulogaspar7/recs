Kauai recommendations
=====================

Notation of [SE], [NE], [SW], or [NW] refers to the corner of the island something is on.  [SE] means Poipu and Koloa; [NE] means Hanalei and Princeville; [SW] means Waimea, Hanapepe, and Kekaha; [NW] means Waimea Canyon.

Food
----
* Koloa Fish Market is my favorite plate lunch on the island. [SE]
* Hamura's Saimin in Lihue for the food and the lilikoi pie. [SE]
* JoJo's in Waimea has my favorite shave ice.  Annoyingly, there are actually two shave ice places very close to each other named JoJo's, and one is much better.  You want the one at Panako Road & Waimea Road, NOT the one on the main highway. [SW]
* Hanapepe has an art walk on Friday nights with some good food carts. [SW]
* Waimea has the Waimea Brewing Company, which by mainland standards is nothing that special but in the land of the blind etc. [SW]
* There is supposedly an old lady who sells malasadas in the Kukui Grove mall in the morning, but I was never able to find her open for business.  She might be an urban legend. [SE]
* There's a pretty decent burger place called Bubba's with a few locations on the island, including in Poipu and Kapaa.
* Puka Dogs in Poipu does hot dogs with different tropical butters and relishes.  Something like a hot dog with coconut butter and lilikoi relish doesn't sound that great, but trust me, it is. [SE]
* There is a Costco behind the Kukui Grove mall, helpful if you want to stock up on supplies and not break the bank eating out. [SE]

Hikes
-----
* The Kalalau Trail on the North Shore (starts at Ke'e Beach) is awesome.  You can hike in as far as you want (some people do multiple days).  About two miles from the start you hit another beach, that's a good turning-around point.  It's a fairly strenuous hike but won't kill you.  One of my all-time favorite hikes. [NE]
* The Maha'ulepu trail on the South Shore starts at Shipwreck Beach off Poipu Road.  It's pretty short, relaxed, and right on the ocean.  Good opportunity to spot sea turtles. [SE]
* The Kuilau Ridge Trail is very nice, very green, and very overlooked by other hikers. [NE]
* There's all kinds of crazy hiking in Waimea Canyon, you can't go wrong.  Note that it can get very fogged in up there sometimes. [NW]

Views
-----
* The view from the Princeville St. Regis on the North Shore is amazing - no need to eat dinner there, just check out the bar at sunset.  An all-time favorite. [NE]
* Waimea Canyon offers a bunch of spectacular lookouts.  The [Kalalau Lookout](http://photos.noahveltman.com/#places?id=150), near the very end of the road, is my favorite, but also the most likely to be obscured by fog. [NW]
* There's a scenic overlook of Hanalei Valley right off the main highway (NE)


Snorkeling
----------

For snorkel gear, you can rent pretty cheaply from Snorkel Bob's, which has several locations on the islands.  Alternatively, you can buy cheap equipment from the Costco near the airport when you arrive.

My favorite snorkeling spots:

* Ke'e Beach (by the start of the Kalalau Trail) [NE]
* Poipu Beach Park (just a short walk down the beach from the Kiahuna Plantation, look for the sandbar jutting out perpendicular from the beach) [SE]
* Tunnels Beach on the North Shore [NE]

Where to stay
-------------

There are three main areas to stay in Kauai with lots of lodging/food options: the North Shore (Princeville and Hanalei), the East Shore (Kapaa, Wailua, Lihue), and the South Shore (Poipu).

The East Shore is a bit cheaper, probably because it's a little more urbanized and not as close to the best beaches and hiking.  My favorite of the three is the South Shore.  There are nice beaches, lots of places to stay/eat, and most importantly, it's a good jumping off point for the rest of the island.  Kauai is mostly served by one loop road, and it doesn't connect all the way around (think of a line around a clock, going clockwise from noon to 10pm).  In Poipu you're close to halfway around the loop, so you can get to either end in less than an hour.  But if you stay in Hanalei, and want to to Waimea, you're looking at 2 hours because you have to go around the long way.  For bonus points, the entrance road into Koloa is an awesome tree tunnel.

In Poipu, I'm a big fan of [Kiahuna Plantation](http://www.outrigger.com/hotels-resorts/hawaiian-islands/kauai/outrigger-kiahuna-plantation).  It's got a great location right on the beach, and it's significantly cheaper than a lot of the surrounding options (warning: no A/C).

Other
-----

* One of my favorite Kauai spots is Kekaha Beach on the far west of the island.  It's very sleepy over there, and there's a huge beach that you can get all to yourself.  Really cool, especially near sunset.  You also get a view of the island of Ni'ihau off to the west.  Works out well to stop here if you're driving back from Waimea Canyon in the afternoon. [SW]
* Hanalei Bay is great and pretty calm (at least in the summer, not sure about this time of year), if you want to do anything in the water - paddleboard, canoe, jump off a pier, whatever - this is a good place for it.  Either way it's worth taking a stroll along the beach. [NE]
* If you're feeling ambitious you can rent a kayak near the Wailua river and kayak up it.  Once you get upriver there are some little mini-hikes to waterfalls and stuff you can do.  It's nice but time-consuming, I wouldn't consider it a priority for a short trip. [NE]
