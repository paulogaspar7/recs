London recommendations
======================

Food
----

* [Tayyab's](http://tayyabs.co.uk/) - the best Punjabi food I've had in London. Really, really good.  But very crowded at peak times, make sure to make a reservation first.  It's BYOB.
* [Lantana](http://www.lantanacafe.co.uk/) - Great Aussie brunch cafe in Fitzrovia.
* Broadway Market - My favorite London food market, more local and less tourist-focused than Borough Market.  Located in Hackney (northeast).
* [Azou](http://www.azou.co.uk/) - in kind of a random location in Hammersmith, but is a total hidden gem.  Tiny Moroccan restaurant with great food, a very friendly owner, and surprisingly cheap.
* [Momo](http://momoresto.com/restaurant/london/momo/restaurant/) - Also Moroccan food, much fancier/more expensive than Azou.  Also very good and much more central (in Mayfair).
* [Dishoom](http://www.dishoom.com/shoreditch/) in Shoreditch  - Bombay cafe-style Indian food.  Very good food and pretty lively.  If you order one thing, make it the lamb.  If you order two things, make it two orders of the lamb.
* [Yalla Yalla](http://www.yalla-yalla.co.uk/) - A few locations, pretty low-key, does great small plates of Lebanese street food.
* [NOPI](http://www.nopi-restaurant.com/) - if you're looking for something a little more upscale, this place is fantastic.  You can also ask to sit in the downstairs area where you can watch the kitchen work, which I think is better.  There is also a more casual sister restaurant, [Ottolenghi](http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk/locations), with three locations.
* Borough Market - Near London Bridge, a big gourmet food market, especially bustling Thursday-Saturday.  If you go, make sure to get a cheese sandwich at [Kappacasein](http://boroughmarket.org.uk/kappacasein-2).
* Caribbean takeout shops - My two favorites are Ochi's in Shepherd's Bush and Roti Joupa in Clapham.
* [Launceston Place](http://www.launcestonplace-restaurant.co.uk/) - Want to spend a billion dollars on an incredible meal with lots of fancy things and a Michelin star?  This is the place!
* Exmouth Market - A great street food market, only open on weekdays at lunchtime though.
* Tea & Tattle - A little tea shop below a bookstore across the street from the British Museum.  A good option for a casual afternoon tea if you're in the area.  A much fancier, more traditional afternoon tea option is the [Lanesborough Hotel](http://www.lanesborough.com/).
* Beigel Bake - Jewish deli open 24/7 on Brick Lane.  Get a salt beef beigel.
* [Cha Cha Moon](http://www.chachamoon.com/) - A lowkey Asian noodle place near Oxford Circus I'm fond of.  Order the mooli cakes.
* [St. John's](https://www.stjohngroup.uk.com/) - Great food, fairly meat-focused with lots of uncommon dishes like game, organ meats, and bone marrow.  Has two locations, a fancier restaurant near Barbican and a more casual, small plates restaurant near Spitalfields.
* The bar with no name at 69 Colebrooke Row - for cocktails.  Cocktails are food, right?  Located near the Angel tube station.  [The Lucky Pig](http://theluckypig.co.uk/) is another nice cocktail bar that's surprisingly low-key on weekdays.
* Non-specific: Turkish food in Dalston, Vietnamese food on "Pho Mile" in Shoreditch, Caribbean food in Brixton.

Views
-----

* The standards: the London Eye, the top of The Shard (recently-completed building, tallest in Western Europe).  Normally the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral, but it's closed for renovation.
* The secret: Sushi Samba and The Duck & Waffle are two restaurants at the top of Heron Tower in The City, near Bank station.  They offer great views of the city without a ticket or crowds.  Duck & Waffle is a real restaurant so you generally need a reservation to go up, but Sushi Samba has a bar area, so you can just show up and ride the elevator up to the 39th floor for the view.
* Others: Parliament Hill in Hampstead Heath; Primrose Hill; the cafe on the top floor of the Tate Modern.

Walks
-----

* One of my favorite walks is to start in the West End, walk north through Regent's Park to Primrose Hill (the actual hill), enjoy the view, and then go through Primrose Hill (the neighborhood of same name) and over to Camden.
* Another great area to walk around is Highbury/Islington/Angel.  You could start at the Highbury & Islington station and make your way south, or start in Central London and head north.
* Shoreditch is the center of hipster London, that's where you should go for funky boutiques, artsy graffiti, and elaborate mustaches. Brick Lane is fun on the weekends, it becomes a big cluster of different mini-markets.
* The South Bank is a great walk, the entire stretch from Lambeth Bridge to Tower Bridge has a walkway along the river with nice views and lots of things along the way (the London Eye, the Queen Elizabeth Hall Market, the HMS Belfast, the Tate Modern, etc.).
* Aldgate and the surrounding area is good for a taste of Old London, gaslamps and Jack the Ripper and all that.

Museums
-------

* The Victoria & Albert is pretty great (and free!), with a wide-ranging permanent collection of art, design artifacts, and antiquities.
* The Tate Modern is great for modern art and makes for a good stop on a South Bank stroll.
* Cabinet War Rooms are good for WWII history.
* I loved the Imperial War Museum when I was younger, but haven't been back since they recently reopened it.
* If you like weird stuff, the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons has a great collection of medical artifacts and oddities (some of them rather gruesome).
* The British Library, near King's Cross Station, has an interesting collection of old documents/books, and rotating exhibits on things like antique postage stamps.
* The Royal Observatory in Greenwich is kind of neat, and Greenwich makes for a nice half-day excursion.
* The Horniman Museum in South London is mostly focused on evolutionary biology, but also has an eclectic collection of musical instruments and other cultural artifacts.
* The British Museum, of course.

Transportation
--------------

* The tube is wonderful.  If staying for a few days you'll most likely want a 7-day TravelCard for Zones 1 & 2.  When planning a trip, look at a real map as well as the tube map - some stations on the map are so close together you might as well walk instead of transferring.  The last train is usually just after midnight, so be careful.  If you get caught far from home after that, you'll either have to take a cab (very expensive) or a night bus (very unpleasant).
* In central London, buses tend to be pretty slow.  Consider just walking instead if you aren't going that far.  Board at the front, exit at the rear.  If you're using an Oyster card, you have to tap in when you board but not when you get off.
* If you're taking the Piccadilly Line from Heathrow, make sure you put some pay-as-you-go credit on your card too, since you have to pay for the trip from Zone 6.  5 pounds should be sufficient.
* The bikeshare program (Barclay's Bikes, aka Boris Bikes) is awesome.  It works the same as in other cities: you supply a credit card and pay 2 pounds for 24 hours of access.  Then, for the next 24 hours, you can check out a bike from any of the bikeshare stations for up to 30 minutes.  If you exceed 30 minutes, you have to pay a little bit.  In practice this means that you can keep a bike out all day for 2 pounds total as long as you dock and undock it every 30 minutes.

Phone/Internet
--------------

* If you have an unlocked phone, you can easily get a pay-as-you-go SIM card at any mobile shop.  There's a Vodafone shop right in most of the major train stations if that's where you're arriving.  Vodafone is pretty easy and adequate, but I'm sure the others are good too.
* You can probably forgo data if you don't have the SIM card option, it's easy to hop from one hotspot to the next.  When out and about, you can always scavenge some free WiFi from one of the major cafe chains, like Pret A Manger, Caffe Nero, Starbuck's, or Eat.  They're everywhere.  Look for a network named "The Cloud" or "BT Openzone."  If you're desperate, you can buy a portable WiFi hotspot from Vodafone for about 50 pounds.

Miscellaneous
-------------

* The Columbia Road Flower Market is on Sunday mornings, it's sort of fun, very crowded, and not necessarily all that practical as a visitor since there are lots of nice flowers and you have no use for them! It's pretty close to Brick Lane and that whole scene so makes for a good add-on if you're going to be in East London on a Sunday.
* London is full of great pubs, but finding your favorite is a journey you have to take yourself.
* Taking a boat along the Thames is a good option if the weather's decent, you can hop a ride from most of the piers in central London.
* Oxford Street and Knightsbridge are two big shopping areas.  Needless to say, I haven't spent much time in them!
* I'm not usually one for organized tours, but the Jack the Ripper walking tour that leaves from Tower Hill station every night is a good one.  Try to go on one of the nights when Donald Rumbelow is leading it (see [this schedule](http://www.jacktheripperwalk.com/index2.html)).
* The food halls at Selfridge's, Fortnum & Mason, or Harrod's, if you're into that sort of thing.
* Of London's many parks, my favorite is Regent's Park.  Richmond Park is also really beautiful and well worth the trip if you've got several days in town, but it's a lot farther out from central London.
* I don't know much about hotels, but have heard good things about [Town Hall](http://townhallhotel.com/home), which is reasonably priced by London standards. In general I'd recommend staying in East London or the South Bank. It's easy to get around, and if you try somewhere central it will cost you a billion dollars and be a shoebox.
